# Activity-15----Github-Practice

### Repository Plan
- Use the main branch for finalized, stable versions of the Activity 14 files.
- Use the dev branch to make changes, updates, and improvements before merging into main.
- Create issues for tasks or improvements and link commits and pull requests to those issues.

### Activity 14 Plan
- Keep the Activity 14 QMD file under version control and update it if any corrections are needed.
- Re-knit the QMD file into a PDF when major changes are made and upload the new PDF.
- Use meaningful commit messages that describe what changed and why.
